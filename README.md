I'm an energy researcher focusing on optimization under uncertainty for renewable generation. Currently, I'm a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm also a National Science Foundation-funded intern for Shell plc working on renewable power integration.  

Some of my current projects include:
- Probabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance using sky-cameras (among other exogenous inputs)
- Optimal dispatch of stored power under uncertainty 
- Aggregation of distributed generation, storage, and microgrid  
- Microgrid design using location-based variational analysis of weather and specific load requirements  

On the side, my largest hobby is learning, especially learning how to program better. Ask me what my current learning endeavor is--hopefully it's just one. In addition, I enjoy spending time with my family, running, and being involved at my church.
